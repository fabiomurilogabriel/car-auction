# Test Summary

## Running Tests

Just need .NET 8.0 SDK installed:

```bash
# Run everything
dotnet test

# Run the main challenge scenario
dotnet test --filter "ExactChallengeScenario_5MinutePartition_ShouldMeetAllRequirements"
```

## What's Tested

**Unit Tests** - Individual components like auction state machines, bid validation, and conflict resolution

**Integration Tests** - Full scenarios including:
- The main 5-minute partition challenge(configured to have some seconds)
- Different CAP theorem trade-offs
- Performance under load
- Various network partition scenarios

## Challenge Requirements

All the main requirements are covered:
- CAP theorem trade-offs for different operations
- Network partition handling
- Bid reconciliation after partitions heal
- Performance requirements (latency, throughput, availability)

## The Main Test

The `ExactChallengeScenario` test simulates the exact scenario from the challenge:
1. Create auction in US-East
2. Place initial bid
3. Network partition happens for 5 minutes
4. Local bid gets rejected (consistency priority)
5. Cross-region bid gets queued (availability priority)
6. Partition heals
7. All bids get reconciled properly
8. No data is lost

## Key Algorithms

**Conflict Resolution** - When multiple bids compete, highest value wins, with timestamp as tiebreaker

**Reconciliation** - After partition heals, collect all queued bids, resolve conflicts, determine winner

**Partition Detection** - Simulated for tests, but tracks complete lifecycle of network issues

## Coverage

The tests cover all the important stuff:
- State machines work correctly
- Bids get ordered properly
- Conflicts resolve deterministically
- Performance meets requirements
- No data gets lost during network issues

Over 25 tests total, covering everything from basic functionality to complex distributed scenarios.
