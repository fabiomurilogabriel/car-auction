# Distributed Car Auction Platform - Senior Engineering Challenge

## Overview

This is a complete implementation of a distributed car auction system that operates in two geographical regions (US-East and EU-West), with special focus on network partition handling and CAP theorem trade-offs.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server (or InMemory for tests)

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
dotnet test

# Specific challenge scenario
dotnet test --filter "ExactChallengeScenario_5MinutePartition_ShouldMeetAllRequirements"

# With code coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Generate HTML coverage report (optional)
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
reportgenerator -reports:"tests/**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverage-report" -reporttypes:Html
```

### Install XPlat Code Coverage
```bash
# Install coverage tool (if not already installed)
dotnet add package coverlet.collector

# Or install globally
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-coverage
```

### Database Setup
```bash
# SQL Server
sqlcmd -S localhost -d CarAuctionDB -i database/Schema.sql
```

### Main Components

#### 1. **Domain Models**
- **Vehicle**: Base class with TPH inheritance (Sedan, SUV, Hatchback, Truck)
- **Auction**: State machine with optimistic version control
- **Bid**: Bids with sequencing and origin tracking
- **PartitionEvent**: Partition event tracking

#### 2. **Distributed Services**
- **AuctionService**: Auction and bid management
- **RegionCoordinator**: Inter-region coordination and partition detection
- **BidOrderingService**: Bid ordering guarantees
- **ConflictResolver**: Post-partition conflict resolution

#### 3. **Data Layer**
- **Repositories**: Repository pattern with Entity Framework
- **AuctionDbContext**: Context with optimized configurations
- **BidSequence**: Atomic sequence generation

## Consistency Decisions (CAP Theorem)

### 1. Creating an Auction: **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**

**Decision:** Strong Consistency

**Why:**
- Avoiding duplicate auctions is critical for business integrity
- Vehicle validation must be atomic (one vehicle = one active auction)
- Creation failure is preferable to inconsistencies

### 2. Placing a Bid: **Hybrid (CP local, AP cross-region)**

**Local Bids (same region):** **CP**
- Strong consistency within the region
- ACID transactions with optimistic version control
- Immediate failure if conflict detected

**Cross-Region Bids:** **AP during partitions**
- Availability priority during network partitions
- Bids queued for later reconciliation
- User receives "bid queued" confirmation

### 3. Ending an Auction: **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**

**During Partitions:**
- Auctions are **paused** until complete reconciliation
- No auction ends with inconsistent data
- Final result integrity is guaranteed

**Post-Partition:**
- Complete reconciliation before determining winner
- All bids are ordered deterministically
- Final result is consistent across all regions

### 4. Viewing Auction Status: **Configurable (Strong vs Eventual)**

**Different levels based on context:**

**Strong Consistency (CP):**
- View for **placing final bid** (critical decision)
- View for **administrators** (auditing)
- Queries with `ConsistencyLevel.Strong`

**Eventual Consistency (AP):**
- View for general **browsing**
- Auction lists for **discovery**
- Queries with `ConsistencyLevel.Eventual`

## CAP Decisions Summary

| Operation | CAP Choice | Justification |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Create Auction** | **CP** | Critical integrity - avoid duplicates |
| **Local Bid** | **CP** | Strong consistency within region |
| **Cross-Region Bid** | **AP** | Availability during partitions |
| **End Auction** | **CP** | Final result must be consistent |
| **View (Critical)** | **CP** | Important decisions need current data |
| **View (Browse)** | **AP** | User experience - always available |

### Partition Strategy

**During Partition:**
- âœ… Local bids continue normally (CP)
- âœ… Cross-region bids are queued (AP)
- âœ… Auctions scheduled to end are paused
- âœ… Partition events are logged for auditing

**Post-Partition (Reconciliation):**
- âœ… All bids are ordered by timestamp + sequence
- âœ… Conflicts resolved deterministically
- âœ… Final state consistent across regions
- âœ… Complete audit trail maintained
- âœ… No bids are lost

## Implemented Partition Scenario

### Specific Problem Solved:
```
Network Partition: Connection between US-East and EU-West is lost for 5 minutes

During partition:
âœ… EU user tries bid on US auction â†’ Queued for reconciliation
âœ… US user bids on same US auction â†’ Processed normally  
âœ… Auction scheduled to end during partition â†’ Paused until reconciliation

Post-partition:
âœ… No bids are lost
âœ… Winner determined deterministically
âœ… Auction integrity maintained
```

## Database Design

### Main Features:
- **TPH (Table-Per-Hierarchy)** for vehicle inheritance
- **Optimistic version control** for auctions
- **Atomic sequencing** for bids
- **Optimized indexes** for distributed queries
- **Partition tracking** for auditing
